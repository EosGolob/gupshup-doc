1. What is log  
   Logging is a basic practice in software development process that offers developers an understanding of what is happening within a program.
   Spring Boot contains different logging levels to classify the log messages.
   The common log levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, and TRACE. 
   We can choose the suitable log level for a specific message based on our requirement & its importance.

	this all things we can achived by profile setting.
implementation 
Step 1 copy application to property file and rename the file like 
       application-pro.properties
	 2 define one properties in spring-boot application.properties file 
	     ex - spring.Profile.active=prod;
	 Note:- if we define any profile in main application.properties file the higher perferance is the set profile name;
	 
	 
3 what is @configuration properties.

  Spring Boot @ConfigurationProperties lets developers map or bind the entire external configuration values in .properties or .yml files to Java objects.
  
4 what is Actuator 

 Step 1  we have to add one dependency spring boot Starter Actuator;
 
      2 we have to hit the url with endpoint /actuator
	  Note:- if we enable actuator it will expose only default endpoint health.
	  
     if we want more endpoint we have do configuration in application.properties files.
     properties Name in file = management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*;
